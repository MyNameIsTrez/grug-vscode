# grug vscode

This is the VS Code extension for my modding language called grug, which I described in detail [in my blog post](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/02/29/creating-the-perfect-modding-language.html).

## Publishing updates

`sudo npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
`sudo vsce package`
`sudo vsce publish`
